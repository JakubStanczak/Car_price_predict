# Car_price_predict

This project was created during the Machine Learning course I took.
It Allowed me to push myself even further during the course and achieve even better results.
This problem was previously solved during a Kaggle competition, so I also had the opportunity to compare my score with others.

The data contains real world information about cars and the goal is to predict their price. 

In the notebook Car_price.ipynb I attempt to show not only the solution I came up with but also the line of reasoning that brought me there.
The final presented prediction was as good as the best 10% in the previously mentioned Kaggle competition (It was closed before I started working on it, so I do not appear in the leaderboard, but I could still post predictions and check my score)
