# Car_price_predict

This project was created in connection with an ML course I took.
It Allowed me to push myself even further during the course and achieve even better results, and to compare with others since
it was a Kaggle competition (closed before I started working on it but I could still post predictions and check my score)
Data contains information about cars and the task is to predict their price. 

In notebook Car_price.ipynb attempt to show not only the solution I came up with but also the line of trough that brought me there.
The final presented score was good enough that it would allow me to get to best 10% i the previously mentioned Kaggle competition.
